# RealTimeTrafficControlSystem

This project presents a real time smart traffic control system designed to enhance cars and pedestrian flow at intersections using simple and low cost technology. The main components include a Raspberry Pi Four, a USB camera, and a portable charger to form a compact and mobile computer vision unit. The Raspberry Pi uses the package of YOLO, or you only look once, which is an object detection algorithm to capture and analyze live video feeds to identify and quantify cars and pedestrians in specified zones. Through a remote SSH, or secure shell, connection via PuTTY with X11 forwarding, a GUI application is rendered on a laptop to monitor the detection process in real-time. Once YOLO completes its data processing, the information is transmitted to a Google Firebase Realtime Database. This ensures low latency communication between the Raspberry Pi device and cloud storage, allowing for the integration of real world sensor data to be used with anything. The data includes the number of cars and pedestrians at various lanes and crossings, forming the input for the next phase of the system, the traffic state prediction and simulation. 
A fully connected neural network, developed and trained in Python, acts as the predictive model for determining the optimal traffic light configuration based on the collected data. The model was given three outcomes to choose from based on seven possible scenarios and considers dynamic inputs to recommend whether the system should prioritize vehicle movement, pedestrian crossing, or hold a base state. After training, this model was exported and integrated into a modern Angular based front end application. The Angular front end performs as a real-time simulation dashboard. It connects directly to Firebase to pull the most recent traffic data, feeds this data into the pre-trained neural network model, and updates a visual interface of traffic lights accordingly. Furthermore, this front end UI, or user interface, was published on GitHubâ€™s web hosting platform for anyone to see the simulation. All of this tightly integrated system demonstrates the viability of combining edge computing, machine learning, cloud based communication, and web technologies to build a responsive, scalable, and intelligent traffic control solution. The project serves as a foundation for future smart city infrastructure that can adapt in real time to traffic patterns, improving safety, efficiency, and reducing the carbon dioxide of cars.
